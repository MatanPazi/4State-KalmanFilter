# 4State-KalmanFilter
Implemented a 4 state Kalman filter and compared it to a complementary filter w/ an Arduino, using an IMU

The main file Performs all the calculations of the Complementary filter & the Kalman filter.
Also executes all the sensor readings and send the data to the PC for plotting.

The measuring variance file was used to simply measure the variance for the Kalman filter matrices

And the plotting script was used to plot the data being sent from the Arduino
